### Bar chart

![bar chart](/figure/barchart.png)

For this type of data, you are expected not just to describe, but also to compare and contrast the information

#### You can use comparative form to compare two or more items

##### "more/fewer/less + noun + than"
> Example: Overall, more students sat examinations in science-related subjects than in art-related subjects.

##### adjectives of one syllable: "-er + than"
> Example: A higher percentage of students gained top marks in Mathematics than Chemistry.

##### "more/less + adjective" of more than one syllables + than
> Example: Science-related subjects were more popular than art-related subjects.

#### You can use superlative froms to compare one item with the remainder of the group:

##### adjectives of one syllable: "-est"
> Example: The highest percentage of students gaining top marks was Mathematics.

##### "the most/least + adjective" of more than one syllable
> Example: The most popular subject was Mathematics.

#### You can use "as + adjective + as" to express similarity
> Example: Art and Design was nearly as popular as Chemistry.

#### Use adverbs to make your comparisons more exact

##### To emphasize the difference, you can use: "many, much, far, and significantly"
> Example: Many more students sat examinations in science-related subjects.
> Example: Science-related subjects were much more popular than art-related subjects.

##### For small differences you can use: "slightly or nearly as ... as"
> Example: The percentage of students gaining top marks in Chemistry was slightly higher than the percentage of students gaining top marks in Art and Design.
> Example: Nearly as many students sat the Art and Design exam as did the Chemistry exam.

#### You can use expressions for express difference or express similarity

##### "On the other hand; Whereas; In contrast"
> Example: The percentage of top marks was quite high in subjects such as Mathematics, which traditionally regarded as difficult. On the other hand, the percentage of top marks was relatively low in subjects such as HFT, which are commonly regarded as soft.
> Example: Whereas 45 per cent of Mathematics candidates gained top marks, only 13 per cent of Media, Film and Television candidates gained top marks.

##### "Similar; both ... and ..."
> Example: Similar numbers of students sat examinations in Art and Design and in Chemistry.
> Example: Sixteen per cent of students gained top marks in both Physical Education and Computing.
