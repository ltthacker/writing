### Question type

There are four types of Task 2 question. 
The question type will determine how you plan and write your essay.
Each type requires you to do something different.

#### Propose one or more solutions to a problem

This type of question either contains the word _should_ or it can be rephrased with the word _should_
> Example: _How can the problem of inequality in the workplace best be addressed?_ = How should we solve the problem of inequality?

#### Evaluate one or more solutions to a problem

Similar as above
> Example: _Many people believe that boys and girls learn better when they are educated separately. What is your view on this practice?_ = Should boys and girls be educated separately?

#### Present your ideas about a topic

This type of question usually requires you to make a prediction or write about causes and/or effect.
> Example: _What do you see as the main reasons for gender inequality in the workplace?_ = What are the causes of gender inequality in the workplace?

#### Evaluate an idea about a topic

This type of question asks you to consider the truth value of a prediction, an explanation or a statement.
> Example: _Many people maintain that boys are naturally more aggressive than girls. To what extent do you agree with this view?_ = Consider the truth value of the statement that boys are naturally more aggresive than girls
