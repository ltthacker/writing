#### Identify how you feel about the topic

Once you have analysed the title, you need to generate ideas. 
It helps to begin by identifying how you feel about the topic.

* A: agree
* D: disagree
* SD: strongly disagree

#### Give reasons for your opinions

When you write your essay, you must give reasons for your opinions. 
You should also show that you have 'tested' your opinion by comparing it with at least one other opinion and examine the reasoning behind it.
